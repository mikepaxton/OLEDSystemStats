An OLED display used for showing specific stats of the Raspberry Pi.

These stats are currently:
Host Name
IP address
CPU Usage
Memory Usage
Disk Usage
CPU Temp

This is a modified version of stats.py supplied by Adafruit in there SSd1306 OLED display driver for Raspberry Pi.
It's currently setup to use I2C as the interface there for I2C must be enabled under raspi-config interfaces option.

Also discovered the PIL library used to display the text on the OLED display is pretty much obsolete and instead
I installed the Pillow library which is a drop in replacement.

I'm using DejaVuSansMono-Bold.ttf font which produces a slightly better looking font on the OLED display over that of
the default font.  This font can be installed by installing fontconfig by way of sudo apt install fontconfig.
Once installed copy the font from /usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu to the same location as the stats.py script.

I use /etc/rc.local on the Raspberry Pi to execute stats.py on system boot.
